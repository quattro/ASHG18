Reversing GWAS to identify and model genetic subtypes
-----------------------------------------------------
- Sub-phenotyping using bespoke algorithm
- MFMR remains calibrated even when there are no subtypes!
- Population structure can confound subtyping
 - Include genotyping PCs to control
- Run on METSIM data
 - 3/4 GWAS hits show strong evidence in support of subgroups
- Use subgroup as a covariate and investigate GxE using GxEMM random effects
 - Strong evidence in support for heterogeneity by subtypes (P < 10e-7)
