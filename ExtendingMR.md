Tissue-specific influence of gene expression on neurological and psych traits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- GWAS SNPs are in non-coding regions
- Goal is to map SNPs to 'causal' genes
- 2-sample MR to estimate causal effect between GeneExpr + Outcome
- Extended MR to use multiple exposures (gene expression) with outcome
 - Single SNP MR using Wald Ratio
 - Performed colocalization analysis to post QC MR results
