Methylation + PrCa risk
-----------------------

- Use genetic variants as instruments
- methylation prediction using local SNPs
- Build CpG methylation prediction models using FHS data
 - evaluation associations of predicted meth levels with iCOGs-OncoArray data
 - sig. CpG sites: assess with expression of nearby genes in FHS
 - association between expression of nearby genes with PrCa risk
- Fitted models for 200k CpG sites
 - 80k have R2 >= 0.01 --> 77k have no SNPs in binding site
 - data predicted well out-of-study
- Apply to iCOGS-OncoArray PrCa summary data using MetaXcan
 - 15 novel risk regions (1Mb?)
- 15 associations
 - NCOA was strong candidate gene having evidence of CpG site + SNP + gene expression association with PrCa risk
