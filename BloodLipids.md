Splicing variation + blood lipid levels
---------------------------------------
- Noncoding GWAS -> perturb gene expression -> lipid levels
- Noncoding GWAS -> perturb gene splicing -> lipid levels!!!
- Fine-level detail on potential mechanism
- iPSCs and hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) as a model system!
- Aims of project:
    - HLC/iPSC for sQTL discovery
    - Are identified sQTLs informative for lipid biology?
- n=83 iPSCs => hepatocyte cells
- ~1400 sQTL genes at FDR <= 5%
- Majority of sQTLs are near associated exon junction
- STRONG enrichment for sQTLs located in splice windows (small overlap between junction and intron)
- sQTLs found using HLCs replicate in liver
- Forward HLCs for downstream lipid analysis
- COLOC using sQTL and lipid levels
    - Identify 20+ loci that colocalize sQTL or eQTL with lipid GWAS results
    - PGS1 has sQTL in canonical splice site
